CHQZ_lib Version 1.0, 2007 May.

Spectral Element Library 
===================================

Functions developed in this library provide the numerical solution of
some simple boundary value problems in 1D, 2D and 3D geometries by
either Spectral Methods with Galerkin-Numerical Integration (G-NI), in
the case of single domain formulation, or
Spectral Element Methods with Numerical Integration (SEM-NI), in the case
of multi-domain formulation. 
Extrema eigenvalues of discrete operators are also computed in some cases.

The present library includes matlab files we have used to produce some
numerical results published in the books:

Spectral Methods. Fundamentals in Single Domains,
Springer Verlag, Berlin Heidelberg New York, 2006;
