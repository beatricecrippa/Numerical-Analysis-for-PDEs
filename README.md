Laplace problems solved via neural networks.

In problems.py four different classes of Laplace problems are defined:
- 2D with 0 Dirichlet boundary data
- 2D without boundary data
- 2D with varying Dirichlet boundary data
- N-dimensional with varying boundary data

In pdebase.py classes for the solution of the previous problems via neural networks are defined.

Run problem1.py, problem2.py, problem3.py and problemN.py to get the solution and display the approxiamtion errors.
Before running the problems, create in your directory folders named "p1", "p2", "p3", "pN" respleively, where the graphs will be saved.
